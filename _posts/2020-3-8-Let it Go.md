title: Let it Go
---

One month ago, I came across a situation that I find myself being cheated. I am angry. Being angry is a normal human emotion when we find ourselves mistreated. The moment I found out about it, my mind was full of furies like a ballon about to explode if given an additional little stimuli. What should I do? I tried to use what I learned from Feeling Good to calm myself. 

The fact - I am cheated. My trust over others has been exploited. 
My feelings - Extremly angry, feeling unfair and even questioning the worth of being honest
My thought - I have two immediate thoughts falling into two extreme directions: 
1. One direction - assuming I am a saint with an altruistic mindset and behave extremely kindly and objectively and even forget my position in the situtation, I need to fix it. The situtaion displays an issue of a person that needs to be fixed. I have to help this person to become more moral, ethical and honest. 
2. The opposite direction - I extremely care about my emotions and feelings, I would act towards what my negative feeling points out. I need to revenage. I need to disclose the dishonest of this person and punish him. 

But would these thoughts be helpful to make me less angry?

They're not. 

Being angry is not my best self-interest. The best revenage is to live better and treat myself better. Let it go is the best solution here for my best peacefulness and to move on a new chapter.
